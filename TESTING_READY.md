## 💡 TESTING TIPS

### For Best Results:
- Test in order (registration → auth → admin → officer → customer → integration)
- Use Chrome DevTools (F12) to check for console errors
- Test one feature completely before moving to next
- Document issues immediately when found
- Take screenshots of any bugs

### Google Maps:
- Should load automatically (API key configured)
- If watermark appears, billing needs enabling in Google Cloud
- Marker colors: Yellow=Pending, Blue=In-Transit, Green=Delivered

### File Uploads:
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
- Max size: 5MB
- Files saved to: static/uploads/profiles/
- Filename format: {userId}-{timestamp}.{ext}

### Database:
- Use MongoDB Compass or Atlas UI to verify data
- Check `users` collection for test accounts
- Check `cargos` collection for shipments
- Verify passwords are hashed (not plain text)
