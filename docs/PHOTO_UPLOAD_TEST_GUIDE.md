## üîç Troubleshooting

### Photos Not Showing?

1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for the üì∏ and ‚úÖ emoji logs
   - If you see errors, copy and report them

2. **Check File Upload**
   - Navigate to `/Users/maintenance/Documents/goFright/static/uploads/profiles/`
   - Verify image files are being created
   - File names should match what you see in the console logs

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open browser dev tools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Upload a photo
   - Look for the POST request to `/api/customer/profile/photo` or `/api/freight-officer/profile/photo`
   - Check the response - should include `user` object with `photoUrl`

4. **Hard Refresh**
   - Try Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - This clears the cache and forces reload

5. **Check authStore**
   - In browser console, type: `localStorage`
   - Look for auth-related data
   - Try logging out and logging back in

### Demographics Not Showing in Admin Panel?

1. **Check if data was saved**
   - Look at the console logs when you click "Save Changes"
   - Should see all 6 demographic fields in the log

2. **Check the Demographics section**
   - In admin users panel, scroll down
   - The Demographics section only shows IF the user has at least one demographic field filled
   - If no data, the section won't appear

### Still Having Issues?

**Backend Server Logs**:
Look at the terminal where you ran `bun dev`. You should see:
- `üì∏ Customer photo upload:` or `üì∏ Freight officer photo upload:`
- `‚úÖ Customer photo saved to database:` or `‚úÖ Freight officer photo saved to database:`

If you see errors in the terminal, that's where the problem is.

**Common Issues**:
- **Port conflict**: Server running on different port (check terminal)
- **File permissions**: Can't create `/static/uploads/profiles/` directory
- **MongoDB connection**: Database not connected
- **Session expired**: Try logging out and back in
