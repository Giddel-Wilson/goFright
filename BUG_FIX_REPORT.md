**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Issues Reported

### Issue #1: Missing Role Selector on Registration Page
**Severity:** Critical  
**Description:** Users could not select their account type (Admin, Freight Officer, Customer) during registration. All new accounts defaulted to "customer" role.

**Impact:**
- Test Officer account was registered as Customer
- Unable to properly test role-based features
- Registration flow incomplete

### Issue #2: Incorrect Login Redirect
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** After login, users were redirected to `/dashboard` instead of their role-specific dashboards.

**Impact:**
- Freight Officers and Customers landed on wrong page
- Expected redirects:
  - Admin → `/admin`
  - Freight Officer → `/freight-officer`
  - Customer → `/customer`
- Actual: Everyone except admin went to `/dashboard`

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Added Role Selector to Registration Form

**File:** `/src/routes/register/+page.svelte`

**Changes:**
1. Added `role` field to `formData` state (default: 'customer')
2. Added dropdown select field in registration form with 3 options:
   - Customer - Book and track shipments
   - Freight Officer - Manage shipments and operations
   - Admin - Full system management
3. Updated `authStore.register()` call to include role parameter

**Code Added:**
```svelte
<div class="space-y-2">
  <Label for="role">Account Type *</Label>
  <select
    id="role"
    bind:value={formData.role}
    required
    disabled={isLoading}
    class="..."
  >
    <option value="customer">Customer - Book and track shipments</option>
    <option value="freight_officer">Freight Officer - Manage shipments and operations</option>
    <option value="admin">Admin - Full system management</option>
  </select>
  <p class="text-xs text-gray-500">Select your account type</p>
</div>
```

### Fix #2: Updated Login Redirect Logic

**File:** `/src/routes/login/+page.svelte`

**Changes:**
Updated `handleLogin()` function to check all three roles and redirect accordingly.

**Before:**
```javascript
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  await navigate('/admin');
} else {
  await navigate('/dashboard'); // ❌ Wrong for freight_officer and customer
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
if (userRole === 'admin') {
  await navigate('/admin');
} else if (userRole === 'freight_officer') {
  await navigate('/freight-officer');
} else if (userRole === 'customer') {
  await navigate('/customer');
} else {
  await navigate('/dashboard'); // Fallback only
}
```
