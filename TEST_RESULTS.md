2. Google Maps integration needs visual verification
3. File uploads need browser file pickers
4. UI/UX testing requires human judgment

**AI Assistant Limitations:**
- Cannot interact with browser UI elements
- Cannot fill out forms or click buttons
- Cannot test visual rendering
- Cannot verify Google Maps display
