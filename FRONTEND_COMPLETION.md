## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Current Implementation
1. **Auth Store** (`src/lib/stores/auth.ts`):
   - Svelte writable store for global state
   - Methods: `login()`, `register()`, `logout()`, `loadUser()`
   - Role checking helper: `hasRoleAccess()`
   
2. **Route Protection**:
   - All `/app/*` routes wrapped in protected layout
   - Automatic redirect to `/login` if not authenticated
   - Auth state persisted via JWT cookie
   
3. **Root Layout** (`src/routes/+layout.svelte`):
   - Calls `authStore.loadUser()` on mount
   - Restores auth state from server
