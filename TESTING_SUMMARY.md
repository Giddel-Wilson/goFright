## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED

### **YOU MUST: Whitelist Your IP in MongoDB Atlas**

This is blocking all testing. Takes ~5 minutes.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Click "Network Access" in sidebar
3. Click "+ ADD IP ADDRESS"
4. Click "ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS" (or use 0.0.0.0/0)
5. Wait 1-2 minutes
6. Restart server: `bun run dev`
7. Look for: ✅ MongoDB connected successfully

**Detailed Guide:** `MONGODB_FIX.md`

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

Testing will be complete when:

- [ ] MongoDB connection working

- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Database operations verified
- [ ] File uploads working
- [ ] Google Maps working on all pages
- [ ] All user workflows tested

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### For MongoDB Fix
- Use 0.0.0.0/0 for quick dev setup (allows all IPs)
- Can restrict to specific IP later for security
- Takes 1-2 minutes to activate after adding

### For Testing
- Use Chrome DevTools (F12) to check for errors
- Test one role at a time systematically
- Take screenshots of any issues
- Update TESTING_PROGRESS.md as you go

### For Google Maps
- Maps should load automatically (API key already set)
- If watermark appears, billing needs enabling in Google Cloud
- Color-coded markers: Yellow=Pending, Blue=In-Transit, Green=Delivered

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Fix MongoDB (Now):**
   - Follow MONGODB_FIX.md
   - Should take 5 minutes

2. **Start Testing (After DB Fix):**
   - Follow TESTING_GUIDE.md systematically
   - Update TESTING_PROGRESS.md
   - Report bugs in TESTING_PROGRESS.md

3. **After Testing:**
   - Fix critical bugs
   - Implement PDF generation
   - Integrate payment gateway
   - Deploy to production
