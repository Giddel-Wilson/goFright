# Freight Officer Auto-Assignment & Route Tracking Implementation

## Date: October 23, 2025

## Overview
Implemented automatic freight officer assignment based on package destination proximity and real-time route visualization on maps showing sender â†’ freight officers â†’ receiver paths.

## Changes Made

### 1. **User Model Updates** (`/src/lib/server/db/models/User.ts`)
Added location fields to support freight officer proximity-based assignment:
- `country` - Freight officer's country
- `location` - Specific location/city
- `latitude` - GPS latitude coordinate
- `longitude` - GPS longitude coordinate

These fields enable distance calculations for intelligent officer assignment.

### 2. **Cargo Model Updates** (`/src/lib/server/db/models/Cargo.ts`)
Added support for multiple freight officer assignments:
- `assignedOfficers: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[]` - Array of assigned freight officers
- Maintains backward compatibility with `assignedOfficerId` for single officer assignment

### 3. **New API Endpoint: Package Details** (`/src/routes/api/admin/packages/[id]/+server.ts`)
**GET** - Retrieve detailed package information with populated freight officers
**PATCH** - Update package properties including:
- Status updates (booked, in_transit, delivered, etc.)
- Single officer assignment (`assignedOfficerId`)
- Multiple officer assignments (`assignedOfficers`)
- Automatic delivery date recording when status changes to "delivered"

### 4. **New API Endpoint: Auto-Assign Freight Officers** (`/src/routes/api/admin/packages/[id]/assign-officers/+server.ts`)
**POST** - Automatically finds and assigns closest freight officers based on:
- **Destination coordinates** extracted from package destination address
- **Haversine formula** for accurate distance calculation
- **Configurable parameters**:
  - `maxOfficers` (default: 3) - Maximum number of officers to assign
  - `maxDistance` (default: 500km) - Maximum distance radius to search

**Features:**
- Searches active freight officers with valid location data
- Calculates distance from each officer to package destination
- Sorts by proximity and assigns the nearest officers
- Returns distance information for each assigned officer
- Supports 50+ cities worldwide including Nigeria, USA, UK, Europe, Asia, etc.

### 5. **LeafletMap Component Enhancements** (`/src/lib/components/LeafletMap.svelte`)
Updated map visualization to show complete delivery routes:

**New Features:**
- **Purple markers** (ðŸŸ£) for freight officers with location info in popups
- **Route visualization** showing origin â†’ officers â†’ destination
- **Dual route lines**:
  - Main route (blue dashed) showing complete path
  - Officer connections (purple dashed) showing officer waypoints
- **Officer popups** display:
  - Officer name and position number
  - Location/country
  - Associated package tracking ID

**Marker Colors:**
- ðŸ”µ Blue - Origin (sender)
- ðŸŸ£ Purple - Freight Officers
- ðŸŸ  Orange - Current package location
- ðŸŸ¢ Green - Destination (receiver)

### 6. **Packages Page UI Updates** (`/src/routes/(admin)/admin/packages/+page.svelte`)
Added comprehensive package management features:

**Status Editing:**
- Click on status badge to edit
- Dropdown with all available statuses
- Save/Cancel buttons for confirmation
- Auto-updates package list and statistics

**Auto-Assign Officers Button:**
- One-click freight officer assignment
- Shows loading state during assignment
- Displays success message with officer count and distance
- Updates package details and map in real-time

**Assigned Officers Display:**
- Purple-themed section showing all assigned officers
- Officer initials in circular avatars
- Location/country information
- Expandable list view

### 7. **Enhanced Package API** (`/src/routes/api/admin/packages/+server.ts`)
Updated to populate `assignedOfficers` with full location data:
- Returns officer coordinates for map rendering
- Includes location and country information
- Maintains performance with selective field population

## How It Works

### Automatic Officer Assignment Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Assign Officers" button on package details
2. System extracts destination coordinates from address
3. Queries all active freight officers with valid GPS coordinates
4. Calculates distance from each officer to destination using Haversine formula
5. Filters officers within maximum distance (500km default)
6. Sorts by proximity and selects top N officers (3 default)
7. Updates package with assigned officers
8. Map automatically updates to show routes through all officers

### Map Route Rendering:
1. Displays origin marker (blue) at sender location
2. Shows freight officer markers (purple) at their GPS coordinates
3. Displays destination marker (green) at receiver location
4. Draws dashed route line connecting: origin â†’ officers â†’ destination
5. Updates in real-time when officers are assigned or package status changes

### Status Update Flow:
1. Admin clicks on current status badge
2. Dropdown appears with all status options
3. Admin selects new status and clicks "Save"
4. API updates package status
5. If status is "delivered", records actual delivery date
6. Package list and statistics refresh automatically
7. Map markers update to reflect new status

## Testing Checklist

âœ… User model accepts location fields (latitude, longitude, country, location)
âœ… Cargo model supports assignedOfficers array
âœ… GET /api/admin/packages/[id] returns package with populated officers
âœ… PATCH /api/admin/packages/[id] updates status successfully
âœ… POST /api/admin/packages/[id]/assign-officers assigns closest officers
âœ… LeafletMap displays freight officer markers
âœ… LeafletMap draws routes through assigned officers
âœ… Status dropdown appears on badge click
âœ… Status update saves and refreshes package list
âœ… Assign Officers button triggers auto-assignment
âœ… Assigned officers section displays in details panel

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins:
1. Navigate to `/admin/packages`
2. Select a package from the list
3. **To update status:**
   - Click on the colored status badge
   - Select new status from dropdown
   - Click "Save"
4. **To assign freight officers:**
   - Click "Assign Officers" button (purple)
   - System automatically finds and assigns closest officers
   - View assigned officers in the details panel below
5. **View routes on map:**
   - Click "Show Map" button
   - See complete route with all waypoints (origin â†’ officers â†’ destination)
   - Purple markers indicate freight officer locations
   - Click markers for detailed information

### For Freight Officers:
- Ensure profile has valid location data (latitude, longitude, country)
- Update location information via profile settings
- System will automatically consider you for nearby package assignments

## Configuration

### City Coordinates Database:
The system includes coordinates for 50+ cities:
- **Nigeria**: Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Ibadan, Port Harcourt
- **USA**: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, etc.
- **Europe**: London, Paris, Berlin, Manchester, Birmingham
- **Asia**: Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Mumbai, Delhi
- **Others**: Sydney, Dubai, Toronto, Vancouver, SÃ£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City

### Adjustable Parameters:
In `/api/admin/packages/[id]/assign-officers/+server.ts`:
- `maxOfficers`: Number of officers to assign (default: 3)
- `maxDistance`: Search radius in kilometers (default: 500km)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Real-time GPS tracking from freight officer mobile devices
- Automatic re-assignment if officer becomes unavailable
- Route optimization algorithm for multiple package pickups
- Estimated delivery time calculation based on distance
- Push notifications to assigned freight officers
- Officer workload balancing
- Historical route playback
- Integration with external mapping services (Google Maps, HERE, Mapbox)

## Files Modified
1. `/src/lib/server/db/models/User.ts`
2. `/src/lib/server/db/models/Cargo.ts`
3. `/src/routes/api/admin/packages/+server.ts`
4. `/src/routes/api/admin/packages/[id]/+server.ts` (new)
5. `/src/routes/api/admin/packages/[id]/assign-officers/+server.ts` (new)
6. `/src/lib/components/LeafletMap.svelte`
7. `/src/routes/(admin)/admin/packages/+page.svelte`

## Technical Notes

### Distance Calculation:
Uses Haversine formula for great-circle distance between coordinates:
```typescript
R = 6371 km (Earth's radius)
a = sinÂ²(Î”lat/2) + cos(lat1) Ã— cos(lat2) Ã— sinÂ²(Î”lon/2)
c = 2 Ã— atan2(âˆša, âˆš(1-a))
distance = R Ã— c
```

### Database Indexes:
Existing indexes on Cargo model support efficient queries:
- `trackingId` (unique)
- `senderId`
- `status`
- `createdAt`
- `destination`

### Security:
- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control (admin-only for assignments)
- Input validation on all parameters
- MongoDB ObjectId validation
